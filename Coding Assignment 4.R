# 1. Read the data into a data frame (make sure that column names do not have spaces in them).

  # Read data int a data frame

  library(readr)
  ufo <- read_csv("ufo_subset.csv")
  View(ufo)
  # Replace spaces in column names with underscores
  colnames(ufo) <- gsub(" ", "_", colnames(ufo))

  
# 2. Find the rows where Shape information is missing and impute with "unknown".
  
  # View rows where shape infomration is missing by subsetting
  missingshaperows <- subset(ufo, is.na(shape))
  # Impute missing shape information with "unknown"
  ufo$shape <- replace(ufo$shape, is.na(ufo$shape), "unknown")
  # Double check there are no na values leftover
  sum(is.na(ufo$shape))

  
# 3. Remove the rows that do not have Country information.
  
  library(dplyr) #load dplyr package so that the filter function can be used
  ufo2 <- ufo %>% filter(!is.na(country))
  # Keep rows that meet a certain condition, where there are no NA values under country
  # Create new data set "ufo2" so that changes can be tracked
  
  
# 4. Convert Datetime and Date_posted columns into appropriate formats
  
  class(ufo2$datetime) # check class of 'datetime'
  
  # 4.1 Separate 'datetime' column into two columns
    library(tidyr)
    ufo3 <- ufo2 %>% separate(datetime, c("date", "time"), sep = " ", remove = TRUE)
    
  # 4.2 Convert date into appropriate format
    # check class of date values
    class(ufo3$date)
    # load lubridate package to convert date values into date data type
    library(lubridate)
    # convert to date data type
    ufo3$date <- lubridate::ymd(ufo3$date)
    
  # 4.3 Convert time into approriate format
    # check class of time values
    class(ufo3$time)
    # convert time to time data type
    ufo3$time <- parse_time(ufo3$time, format = "%H:%M")
    
  # 4.4 Convert date_posted into appropriate format
    # check class of date_posted values
    class(ufo3$date_posted)
    ufo3$date_posted <- lubridate::dmy(ufo3$date_posted)
  
  
# 5. Create a new boolean column delineating whether a sighting is a possible hoax
    
    ufo4 <- ufo3 %>% mutate(is_hoax = case_when(grepl("(?i)HOAX", comments) ~ "TRUE", .default = "FALSE"))
    # Use mutate function to add new column with value "TRUE" when "HOAX" is included in the comments and value "FALSE" when it isn't
    # Included (?i) argument to allow all 'hoax' to be identified regardless of case
    
# 6. Create a table reporting the percentage of hoax sightings per country.
    
    # Group ufo4 data by country, then calculate percentage of TRUE values in is_hoax column over total number of rows per country
    # Multiply result by 100 to obtain percentage value
    percentages <- ufo4 %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(percentage = sum(is_hoax == "TRUE") / n() * 100)
    # Print table
    print(percentages)

    
# 7. Add another column delineating the time difference between the sighting date and reported date
    
    # Calculate time difference in days between date_posted and date
    timedif <- ufo4$date_posted - ufo4$date
    # Add another column to report the time difference
    ufo5 <- ufo4 %>% mutate(report_delay = timedif)
    
    
# 8. Remove the rows where the sighting was reported before it happened.
    
    # Use the filter function to remove rows where the time difference is negative
    ufo6 <- ufo5 %>% filter(!timedif < 0)
    
    
# 9. Create a table reporting the average report_delay per country.
    
   delaypercountry <- ufo6 %>% group_by(country) %>% summarize(average_delay = mean(report_delay))
   print(delaypercountry)

   
# 10. Check the data quality (missingness, format, range etc) of the "duration seconds" column. 
   
   # Explain what kinds of problems you have identified and how you chose to deal with them, in your comments.
   class(ufo6$duration_seconds) # Class is numeric - this is good
   sum(ufo6$duration_seconds < 0) # Sum of zero means there are no negative values
   sum(is.na(ufo6$duration_seconds)) # No NA values - this is good
   range(ufo6$duration_seconds) # Very large range of seconds
   
   # The major problem I identified is that the range of values is extremely large, from 2.00e-02 to 8.28e+07
   # To account for this, the histogram will use the log of duration_seconds so that the shape of the distribution can be visualized
  
   
# 11. Create a histogram using the "duration seconds" column.   
   
   hist(log10(ufo6$duration_seconds), main = "Histogram of Sighting Durations in Seconds", xlab = "Log10 of sighting duration (seconds)", ylab = "Frequency", col = "blue")
